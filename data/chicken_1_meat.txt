tea and chicken soup are said to be the best
I added the meat to the pot of broth and added a can of chicken broth
a match to grilled fish or warm chicken
you can order some olives or roast chicken as delicious appetizers
I gave her some smoked chicken breast at lunchtime 
they ate delicious seafood on the balcony and tender chicken
we sat down and John put fried chicken on to the three plates
A delicious smell of fried chicken 
She felt too tired to cook her chicken dish that night
was pleased with her share of roast chicken
she felt better able to tackle the next course of chicken
they ate chicken
sprinkle over whole chicken or fish
no other recipe causes so much grief with the possible exception of chicken soup
A tin of biscuits , a box of chocolates and a jar of chicken breasts
taste a bit like duck and chicken put together
along with three generous portions of roast chicken	and a delicious apple pie
left Ben and some warm champagne and a plate of dry chicken	sandwiches
she just made a face at the taste of the spicy chicken wings
he was often overcome with temptation when faced with such delights as chicken dumplings
