when i ground the transistor to the battery
the substrate further comprises a second transistor
by the end of that project, we aim to have produced one transistor
the future radio host was given his first transistor radio
output current must also from the transistor
the current is flowing through the transistor and into
while no burst signal is applied to the transistor
with conventional bulk silicon to produce an silicon transistor that is
so no current flows through it into the transistor 
When transistor is off
contributions to the development of the transistor
the capacitor in this case is parasitic from the transistor
The circuit can be used to step up the input impedance of the bipolar transistor
firstly , a current model which characterizes transistor
