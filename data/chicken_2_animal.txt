in a world like today it is dangerous to run around like a chicken without a head
her cup was shaped like a chicken
like a pavement and as bald as a chicken
but it had been a long time since a chicken had shat in that yard
but I am not exactly a chicken any more
the headman had killed a chicken for him
when every hunting party had sacrificed	a chicken here
some of the smaller and most certainly highly active dinosaurs were about the size of a chicken
some were only as big as a chicken
he was always making noises like a chicken
you look out one window you see a chicken
A few weeks before I contracted	chicken	pox
it is not nearly as easy to pass on as chicken pox
searched for the corpse of a chicken or a pig
my Dad told me he saw a headless chicken run round a farm
If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck , it is a duck . Even if it thinks it is a chicken
if you were there you could have learned to dance like a chicken
and starts clucking like a chicken
