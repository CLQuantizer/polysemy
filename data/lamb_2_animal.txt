in sheep the heart-rate of the unborn lamb can be accurately measured
I can tell you that my baby lamb which
she shall bring a lamb
She also had her brother to slaughter a lamb
They even saw a lamb being
and then in front of them appeared a small lamb
and the lion and the lamb shall lie 
horror pierced her before the death of a lamb
by a shepherd looking for a lost lamb
by the sight of a dead lamb
they will have the skin of a lamb
he conducted himself like a lamb or even
to sacrifice the best lamb of his flock
But you have the slaying of the lamb
Mary had a little lamb
little biscuits in the shape of a lamb
